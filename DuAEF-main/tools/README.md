# DuAEF Tools

Extendscript tools provided with the Duduf After Effects Extendscript Framework

- [DuBinary File Converter](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF/blob/master/tools/DuBinary_file_converter.jsx) converts any binary file to an Extendscript `*.jsxinc` file which can then be included `#include file.jsxinc` in your script, and used with the [DuBinary](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF/blob/master/libs/DuBinaryLib.jsxinc) library.
- [DuBinary Folder Converter](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF/blob/master/tools/DuBinary_folder_converter.jsx) recursively converts all binary files in a folder and its subfolders to ExtendScript `*.jsxinc` files.
- [DuBinary File Extractor](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF/blob/master/tools/DuBinary_file_extractor.jsx) extracts a binary file from an ExtendScript `*.jsxinc` file and writes it to the disk. It is an example of how [DuBinary](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF/blob/master/libs/DuBinaryLib.jsxinc) can be used to extract binary files from your scripts at runtime.
